# 2D Gravity Game Built Using Unity
Repo for 2D game Box Guy made in Unity! This was a four month long passion project where I learned Unity by building a 2D platformer centered around the game mechanic of being able to invert your own gravity. I learned many skillsets throughout this project such as game design, game development, animation techniques such as squash and stretch, as well as iterative play-testing. Check out a demo for the game in the link below!
